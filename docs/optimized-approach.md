# Optimized approach to rotating a square matrix

This algorith rotates a square matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise, each element moves to a new position. 

The top row becomes the left most column in reverse order, the second row becomes the second-left most column in reverse order, and so on.

function printMatrix(a[N][N]):

    # 2- Reverse each row (rotate 90Â° clockwise)
